# EncryptedStreamSample

This is a project in C# showing how to use SSL streams to write a basic chat application, since I couldn't find a solid up-to-date example anywhere else.

The app is a bit rough around the edges, but should show the fundamentals of working with SSL/TLS streams in C# using asynchronous programming (in WPF).
